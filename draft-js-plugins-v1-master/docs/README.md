A boilerplate for building static sites with [React][] and [React Router][]

**Quick Start:**

* `npm install`
* `npm start` to run a dev server
* Write an awesome client-side app...
* `npm run build` to minify, package and generate static HTML files from your routes

## Development

**Iportant Note:** This setup does not yet support generating static sites for dynamic routes such as `post/:id`. For more info see [this issue on the react-static-webpack-plugin repo](https://github.com/iansinnott/react-static-webpack-plugin/issues/2).
